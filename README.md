# UE4 Beginner Resource Guide

## Coding Standard

* [Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/CodingStandard/index.html)

> Standards and conventions used by Epic Games in the Unreal Engine 4 codebase.

* [UE4 Style Guide](https://github.com/Allar/ue4-style-guide)

> UE4 C++ and engineering resource naming specification

__`Be sure to read these two documents before writing C++ code in UE4, this will make your code look more professional and more suitable for multi-person cooperation project`__

## Delegate

* [Delegates in UE4, Raw C++, and BP Exposed](https://unreal.gg-labs.com/wiki-archives/macros-and-data-types/delegates-in-ue4-raw-c++-and-bp-exposed)
  
> [The official documents about delegates](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/UnrealArchitecture/Delegates/index.html) are vague and difficult to understand. This article explains the use of delegates very well.

## General System

### Blueprint Visual Scripting

* [Blueprint Visual Scripting](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/index.html)

> The official document contains the concept and usage of blueprints, If you want to understand the blueprint, this document is the best choice for beginner.

## Gameplay

### Animation System

* [Animation System Overview](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/AnimatingObjects/SkeletalMeshAnimation/Overview/index.html)
> Official documents containing the basic concepts of the animation system and all of subsystem about animation.

* [How can I play animations strictly from C++?](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/292345/how-can-i-play-animations-strictly-from-c.html)
> Unreal has two programming methods: Blueprint and C++. It is very important to choose the correct method to meet the needs. It is especially important in animation systems. This question discusses which parts of the animation are more appropriate to use C++ and which are more appropriate to use visual blueprints.
